### B.S. in Computer Science at UVA (School of Engineering and Applied Science)

#### Overview

The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) program is offered by the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS). Students must fulfill SEAS general requirements in addition to completing CS-specific courses.

#### General SEAS Curriculum Requirements

All SEAS students must complete these foundational courses:

- **APMA 1110** - Single Variable Calculus II (4 credits)
- **APMA 2120** - Multivariable Calculus III (4 credits)
- **CHEM 1410/1411** - Introductory Chemistry I & Lab (4 credits)
- **PHYS 1425/1429** - Introductory Physics I & Lab (4 credits)
- **PHYS 2415/2419** - Introductory Physics II & Lab OR **ECE 2200** - Applied Physics (4 credits)
- **ENGR 1010 & 1020** - Engineering Foundations I & II (7 credits)
- **STS 4500** - STS and Engineering Practice (3 credits)
- **STS 4600** - The Engineer, Ethics, and Professional Responsibility (3 credits)

Additional electives:

- Humanities or Social Science Electives: 15 credits (9 credits included in SEAS core requirements)
- Math and Science Elective: 3 credits

#### Differences Between BSCS and BACS Degrees

The BSCS degree is offered through SEAS, while the Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science (BACS) is offered through the College of Arts and Sciences. Key differences:

1. **General Requirements**: BSCS requires SEAS core courses (math, science, engineering). BACS focuses on liberal arts requirements.
2. **Capstone/Thesis**: BSCS requires a fourth-year thesis (STS 4500/4600). BACS students may pursue an optional Distinguished Majors thesis.
3. **CS Electives**: BSCS requires 15 credits (5 courses); BACS requires 9 credits (3 courses).
4. **Integration Electives**: BACS includes 4 integration electives; BSCS does not.

---

#### Cybersecurity Focal Path

Students may pursue the National Center of Excellence in Cyber Defense (NCAE-CD) focal path, requiring 10 courses covering specific cybersecurity Knowledge Units.

---

#### Declaring or Transferring into the BSCS Program

- **Declaring the Major**: Students must submit their preferences during their first year.
- **Transfer Students**:
  - Internal: Apply through the SEAS process; must have completed CS 2100.
  - External: Strongly encouraged to complete foundational courses (e.g., CS 2110, CS 2102) before transfer.

---

#### GPA and Graduation Requirements

- Minimum CS GPA: 2.0
- Senior Thesis Portfolio: Includes the Capstone Technical Report and STS courses.
- Unrestricted Electives: 15 credits from any graded courses except those restricted by the program (e.g., MATH < 1310, SCPS courses).
